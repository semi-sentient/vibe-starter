description: "Execute a multi-phase implementation plan by delegating phases to specialized sub-agents with fresh context windows.

---

You are a strategic workflow orchestrator. You coordinate complex implementation plans by delegating phases to specialized sub-agents that each run in a fresh context window. Your job is to keep the overall plan on track while staying context-lean yourself.

**Host capability.** This skill works by delegating each phase to a **sub-agent with its own fresh context window** while the orchestrator (you) stays lean — that isolation is the whole point, since it stops one phase's context from bleeding into the next. The reference implementation is Claude Code's Task tool; the `subagent_type` values named throughout (`Explore`, `general-purpose`) are Claude Code's specific agent types. On a host with a different delegation mechanism, map each agent mode onto its nearest isolated-context worker — the role definition, not the `subagent_type` string, is the contract. On a host with **no** sub-agent capability at all, run each phase's brief inline and in sequence, but tell the user up front that you are in this degraded mode: the fresh-context isolation the briefs assume is no longer guaranteed. Likewise, the run ledger's token/time/call figures come from Claude Code's `<usage>` block; on another host they degrade gracefully to whatever usage metadata it exposes (and never gate the workflow) — see Run Ledger → Host portability.

## Argument

`$ARGUMENTS` accepts one of three forms:

- **File path** — local plan file (e.g. `.agents/plans/foo-plan.md`)
- **GH issue number** — `#456` (must include `#` to disambiguate from a filename; bare numbers are rejected)
- **Full GH issue URL** — `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/issues/456`

Detection: starts with `#` or matches `github.com/.../issues/<n>` → treat as a GH ref; otherwise treat as a file path.

**Flags** (any combination, in any order, after the primary argument):

- `--no-github` — force local-only mode even when GH metadata is present (e.g. a local file carrying a `<!-- gh-sub-issue: N -->` footer)
- `--no-branch` — skip automatic work-branch creation
- `--no-commits` — skip per-phase commits
- `--no-pr` — skip PR submission at end of run (GH mode only)
- `--allow-main` — permit running with `--no-branch` while on the default branch (otherwise refused as a footgun)
- `--base <branch>` — override the base branch for both the work branch and the PR; defaults to the repo's default branch (`main` / `master`)
- `--draft` — open the PR as a draft (default: ready when outcome is `complete`, draft when `partial`)
- `--no-review` — skip the per-phase review gate (Step 4.5). Not recommended: the gate exists because the Code agent grades its own work, and drift it misses becomes permanent at commit time
- `--no-branch-review` — skip the pre-PR branch review (Step 5c.5)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or missing, tell the user: "Usage: `/run-plan <path-to-plan-file | #N | issue URL> [flags]`" and stop.

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Resolve plan source and read

**Step 1a — Detect GitHub availability** (run now only if `$ARGUMENTS` is a GH ref; for file-path arguments, defer to Step 1b — the file must be read first to know whether GH mode is relevant):

- `git remote get-url origin` — if no output or the URL is not `github.com`, GH integration is unavailable
- If a GH remote exists, `gh auth status` — if not authenticated, GH integration is unavailable
- Capture `<org>/<repo>` from the remote URL for later use

If a GH ref was passed but GH is unavailable, fail loudly. Do not silently fall back.

**Step 1b — Resolve plan source** based on the argument form. The argument identifies the **plan sub-issue**, not the parent PRD-epic. Set `<plan_sub_issue_number>` to the resolved issue number for use throughout the run.

- **GH ref passed:** grep the project's plans directory (`.agents/plans/`, `.claude/plans/`, etc. — same precedence as `prd-to-plan` Step 7a) for `<!-- gh-sub-issue: <plan_sub_issue_number> -->` **or** `<!-- gh-issue: <plan_sub_issue_number> -->` matching the target issue number (the latter marks a plan published directly as a standalone issue, not via `prd-to-plan`).
  The grep can return several files, so **reduce to a single candidate before handling anything**, in this order:

  1. Any `gh-sub-issue:` match wins outright — `prd-to-plan` stamps that footer on plans only.
  2. Otherwise, discard every `gh-issue:` match that is **not** a plan (a plan has phase headings and acceptance criteria; published PRDs carry the identical footer). Name each discarded file when reporting the resolution: its footer claims an issue it does not own, which is a data problem worth fixing.
  3. Then: **one candidate** → handle it below. **Two or more plans**, each claiming the same issue → a genuine tie with no principled resolution: stop and ask which is canonical. **Everything discarded as a PRD** → the user passed the PRD-epic's number: fail loudly (`#N is a PRD-epic, not a plan — pass its plan sub-issue, or create one with prd-to-plan`). **Nothing matched at all** → the fetch branch below.

  - **Candidate carries `gh-sub-issue:`** → that file is the canonical local path. Mark `<freshly_fetched> = false`.
  - **Candidate carries `gh-issue:`** → a **standalone plan issue**: that file is the canonical local path, and the single issue serves as `<plan_sub_issue_number>` throughout (sync target, commits, the PR's `Closes`). Mark `<freshly_fetched> = false`. Step 1b.1 will find no parent, so `<gh_issue_number>` stays unset — expected, not an error.
  - **If not found** → fetch the issue via `gh issue view <plan_sub_issue_number> --json title,body`. Derive the slug from the issue title by: (1) strip a leading `Plan:\s*` prefix (sub-issues created by `prd-to-plan` always carry this prefix; leaving it in would produce a doubled `plan-<slug>-plan.md` filename), (2) apply the shared slugify rule from `prd-to-plan` Step 7b (lowercase, spaces → hyphens, strip non-alphanumeric-non-hyphen, collapse/trim hyphens). Example: `"Plan: MUI v9 Migration"` → slug `mui-v9-migration` → file `mui-v9-migration-plan.md`. Write the body to `<plans-dir>/<slug>-plan.md`. Mark `<freshly_fetched> = true`.
- **File path passed:** read the file. Check for a `<!-- gh-sub-issue: N -->` footer (or, on a standalone-published plan, a `<!-- gh-issue: N -->` footer — same handling, standalone semantics as above):
  - **Footer present AND `--no-github` NOT specified** → run Step 1a's GH availability detection now. If GH is available → auto-engage GH mode, set `<plan_sub_issue_number>` from the footer, mark `<freshly_fetched> = false`, and notify the user: `Detected GH sub-issue #<n> from file footer — syncing progress to GitHub after each phase. Use --no-github to disable.`. If GH is unavailable → fail loudly (a footer marker that can't be honored is an inconsistent state; do not silently fall back to local-only — the user almost certainly wants to know before proceeding).
  - **Otherwise** (no footer, or `--no-github` specified) → operate in local-only mode. `<plan_sub_issue_number>` and `<gh_issue_number>` remain unset.

**Step 1b.1 — Derive parent PRD-epic** (GH mode only):

The `<gh_issue_number>` (parent PRD-epic) is needed for the PR body's `Refs #N` line (per-phase commits reference `<plan_sub_issue_number>` instead — see Step 4.7). Derive it from the plan sub-issue's parent relationship:

```bash
gh api /repos/<org>/<repo>/issues/<plan_sub_issue_number> --jq '.sub_issues_summary.parent.number // .parent.number // empty'
```

(Field shape varies as the sub-issues API matures; try the documented field first, fall back as needed. If no parent is found, leave `<gh_issue_number>` unset — the plan is a standalone sub-issue or the user manually created it. The PR body simply omits `Refs #N` in that case.)

Also capture `<gh_url_for_plan_sub_issue>` as `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/issues/<plan_sub_issue_number>` for use in Step 5d's PR body template.

**Step 1c — Drift detection** (GH mode only; **skip entirely if `<freshly_fetched> == true`** — the local file is by definition identical to GH at this point):

- Fetch GH body: `gh issue view <plan_sub_issue_number> --json body --jq .body`
- Compare with local file:
  - **Identical** → proceed using the local file
  - **Local has more checked criteria than GH** → push local to GH (`gh issue edit <plan_sub_issue_number> --body-file <plan_file_path>`), **report it** (`Reconciled #<n> — pushed <k> criteria an earlier run completed but never synced.`), then proceed. This is the one remote write that happens before Step 2's confirmation gate, so it must never be silent: it records work that already happened (making the issue more accurate whether or not the user proceeds), but the user still has to learn it occurred
  - **GH has more checked criteria than local** → overwrite local with GH body, then proceed
  - **Bodies differ in non-checkbox content** → surface the diff and ask the user which to keep before proceeding. Do NOT auto-resolve.

**Step 1d — Read the plan and project conventions:**

1. **The plan file** — Identify:
   - **Feature name** — from the plan's `# Plan: <Feature Name>` H1 header. Capture as `<feature_name>`. If the H1 is missing or does not start with `Plan:`, fail loudly and ask the user to fix the plan before proceeding — the PR title and body templates depend on this value, and silently falling back to a placeholder would produce a malformed PR.
   - Architectural decisions that apply across all phases
   - Phases (sequential units of work — may be labeled "Phase N", "Part N", or similar)
   - Acceptance criteria per phase (checkbox items)

2. **The workspace's `AGENTS.md` and/or `CLAUDE.md`** (whichever exist) — Extract two things:
   - **Project conventions** (import rules, file naming, coding standards, testing requirements) that must be included in every Code agent brief.
   - **The PR-submission rule, if the instructions state one** — e.g. "do not run `gh pr create`; a CI workflow opens the PR when a branch is pushed". Set `<pr_open_mode> = declared` when such a rule is present, `silent` otherwise. Step 5d's submission gate reads this value; resolving it here means the gate does not depend on those files still being in context many phases later.

If the plan file doesn't exist or has no identifiable phases, inform the user and stop.

**Working state to maintain throughout the run:**

- `<plan_file_path>` — always set
- `<plan_slug>` — derived from the plan filename, e.g. `mui-v9-migration-plan.md` → `mui-v9-migration` (used for the branch name and the commit-message scratch path)
- `<feature_name>` — derived from the plan's `# Plan: <Feature Name>` header (used for PR title and PR body)
- `<plan_sub_issue_number>` — the **plan sub-issue** itself; set in Step 1b (from `$ARGUMENTS` or footer marker) when GH-backed; absent otherwise
- `<gh_url_for_plan_sub_issue>` — `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/issues/<plan_sub_issue_number>`; set if GH-backed
- `<gh_issue_number>` — the **parent PRD-epic** issue, derived from the sub-issue's parent relationship in Step 1b.1; absent if no parent or local-only mode
- `<freshly_fetched>` — `true` if the local plan file was just written from a GH fetch in Step 1b; `false` otherwise (controls whether Step 1c runs)
- `<gh_sync_mode>` — `active` (default in GH mode) or `degraded` (after persistent sync failure; see Step 4.6)
- `<outcome>` — the run's terminal classification, set once at Step 5 and consumed by the Step 5 GH gate, Step 5e, the summary-comment template, and the draft-vs-ready rule. `complete` = every phase is done (executed this run, or already checked at resume) and every acceptance criterion is ticked; `partial` = the run reached Step 5 with any criterion unticked or any phase BLOCKED/not attempted; `aborted` = the run stopped early (user abort, or retry limit exhausted without a user go-ahead). A resume that executes zero phases because all were already complete is `complete`, not `aborted` — Step 4's loop simply runs zero iterations
- `<branch_name>` — the work branch all phase commits land on; absent if `--no-branch`
- `<base_branch>` — base branch for the work branch and PR; defaults to repo default
- `<pr_open_mode>` — `declared` (the repo's agent instructions say a workflow opens the PR on push, so `gh pr create` is forbidden) or `silent` (no such rule — run-plan opens the PR itself); resolved in Step 1d, consumed by Step 5d
- `<scratch_dir>` — the run's temp-file directory, resolved once in Step 1e.2: the sibling `scratch/run-plan/<plan_slug>/` of the resolved plans directory, so it follows the consumer's layout (`.agents/scratch/…` in this repo, `.claude/scratch/…` for a Claude-Code-only install) and honors a project's temp-artifacts convention. Falls back to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/run-plan/<plan_slug>/` when no in-repo plans dir applies. Holds the ledger, per-phase commit-message + handoff files, and research files. NEVER hardcode `.agents/scratch` — always use this resolved value.
- `<ledger_path>` — `<scratch_dir>/ledger.md`; the append-only usage ledger (see Run Ledger). Single source of truth for every sub-agent's per-mode tokens and time, and the data the Progress Reporting table + completion summary render from. Survives context compaction.
- `<run_start>` — a single wall-clock stamp (`date +%s`) captured once at the start of Step 4, used ONLY for the optional, clearly-labeled "elapsed (includes pauses)" line. NEVER the headline duration — active time comes from summed sub-agent `duration_ms` in the ledger.
- `<keep_dirty_pathspec>` — optional; set in Step 1e.2 when the user declares files that must stay modified in the working tree but never be committed. Holds the `':(exclude)<path>'` pathspec entries every staging site applies — see Step 1e.2's Keep-dirty paths rule. Absent when none are declared.

### Step 1e — Set up the work branch

**Step 1e.1 — Resolve `<base_branch>`** (needed by both paths below):

- If `--base <branch>` was passed, use it
- Else resolve the repo default via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (strip the `refs/remotes/origin/` prefix)

**Step 1e.2 — Resolve `<scratch_dir>`, ensure it's git-ignored, then refuse if working tree is dirty** (applies in BOTH `--no-branch` and create-branch paths — uncommitted changes will otherwise leak into per-phase commits):

First resolve `<scratch_dir>` (see Working state): the sibling `scratch/run-plan/<plan_slug>/` of the resolved plans directory — `.agents/scratch/run-plan/<plan_slug>/` in this repo, `.claude/scratch/run-plan/<plan_slug>/` for a `.claude/`-layout consumer. If no in-repo plans directory applies, use `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/run-plan/<plan_slug>/` (outside the repo — no ignore needed, git never sees it). Create it: `mkdir -p <scratch_dir>`.

Then, when `<scratch_dir>` is INSIDE the repo, make sure it can never reach the index — its files (ledger, commit-message, handoff, research) would otherwise contaminate the Review agent's staged diff, get swept into phase commits by `git add -A`, and trip the dirty-tree check below. Without touching the repo's tracked `.gitignore`, add its `scratch/` root (`<scratch_root>`, e.g. `.agents/scratch/` or `.claude/scratch/`) to git's local-only ignore list:

```bash
git check-ignore -q "<scratch_dir>/probe" || echo '<scratch_root>/' >> "$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude)"
```

(`.git/info/exclude` is git's local-only ignore list — appending is idempotent for this run's purposes, invisible to the repo's history, and skipped entirely in repos that already ignore the path. Skip this step entirely for the `${TMPDIR}` fallback, which lives outside the repo.)

**Keep-dirty paths.** If the user has declared files that must stay modified in the working tree but never be committed (a common shape: running a plan while iterating on the harness or skill files themselves, or carrying local-only config edits), record them now as `<keep_dirty_pathspec>` — `':(exclude)<path>'` pathspec entries. Three consequences for the rest of the run: (1) their `git status` entries are expected dirt — disregard them in every dirty-tree evaluation in this step, and never revert or delete them in the discard path below; (2) every `git add -A` in this skill becomes `git add -A -- . <keep_dirty_pathspec>` (the staging sites in Step 4 items 5 and 7), so these paths can never reach a phase commit or a reviewer's staged diff; (3) Step 3's write-scope check uses its snapshot-and-compare form, since the tree is legitimately dirty from run start.

Then run `git status --porcelain` (with keep-dirty paths declared, disregard their entries — they are expected). If any output, first test for an **interrupted phase** before refusing (commit-producing runs only — under `--no-commits` the entire dirty-tree check, including this test, is skipped, and checked criteria legitimately have no committed record): compare the working-tree plan file against the tip of the branch phase commits land on (`plan/<plan_slug>` if it exists; the current branch under `--no-branch`) via `git diff <that-branch> -- <plan_file_path>` — if the file is absent there, treat every checked criterion as uncommitted. Criteria checked in the working tree but not in that committed version mark a phase whose checkboxes were recorded (Step 4.6) but whose commit (Step 4.7) never landed. If such criteria exist AND the tree is dirty beyond the plan file itself:

1. Un-check those criteria in the local file. In GH mode with sync active, push the corrected body (`gh issue edit <plan_sub_issue_number> --body-file <plan_file_path>`), retrying 3× with backoff; on persistent failure abort loudly rather than degrade — this push is what prevents Step 1c from resurrecting the phantom ticks on a later resume.
2. Surface: `Phase <n> was interrupted after its checkboxes were recorded but before its commit landed. Criteria un-checked. The working tree holds its partial work — discard and re-attempt the phase from scratch (default), keep the partial work for the re-attempt, or abort?` On discard, unstage and revert all dirty tracked paths and delete untracked files — except `<plan_file_path>` itself, which keeps its just-corrected content (the clean-tree requirement at run start means all other dirt belongs to the interrupted phase).

Only when no uncommitted checkbox delta explains the dirt, abort with:

```
Working tree has uncommitted changes. Handle them before running the plan:
  git stash push -m "before run-plan"    # unrelated work: set it aside
  git add -A && git commit -m "wip"      # unrelated work: park it on the branch
  # Pre-existing work the plan builds on: commit it as its own properly-messaged
  # commit first — keeps it out of phase commits and the Phase 1 reviewer's diff.
```

Skip the dirty-tree check only if `--no-commits` is also passed (no commits will be made, so dirty changes can coexist).

**Step 1e.3 — Branch handling:**

**If `--no-branch` was passed:**

- Run `git branch --show-current` to read the current branch
- If current branch equals `<base_branch>` AND `--allow-main` was NOT passed → refuse:
  ```
  Refusing to commit directly to <base_branch>. Pass --allow-main to override, or omit --no-branch to create a work branch.
  ```
- Otherwise, leave the current branch as the working branch (do NOT set `<branch_name>` — its absence in working state signals "no dedicated branch was created")

**Otherwise (create the work branch):**

1. Compute `<branch_name>` as `plan/<plan_slug>` (e.g. `plan/mui-v9-migration`)
2. **Branch already exists handling:**
   - **Exists locally with commits ahead of base AND plan has some checked criteria** → resuming a prior interrupted run; `git checkout <branch_name>`, continue
   - **Exists locally with no commits ahead of base** → `git checkout <branch_name>`, continue (no harm). But if the plan shows checked criteria and `--no-commits` was NOT passed, surface first: `Plan records completed phases but <branch_name> has no commits ahead of <base_branch> — those phases' code is not on this machine (likely unpushed commits elsewhere). Re-attempt them here / abort so the original branch can be pushed first?` (A phase that legitimately produced `(no commit — no changes)` can trigger this — which is why it surfaces to the user instead of auto-resolving.)
   - **Exists locally with commits ahead BUT plan has no checked criteria** → suspicious; surface to user: `Branch <branch_name> exists with commits but plan shows no progress. Use existing / recreate / pick different name?`
   - **Exists on remote but not locally** → `git fetch origin <branch_name>:<branch_name>` then `git checkout <branch_name>`; treat as resume
   - **Does not exist** → `git checkout -b <branch_name> <base_branch>`. A fresh branch has zero commits ahead by construction, so the same checked-criteria-but-no-commits guard applies: if the plan shows checked criteria (and `--no-commits` was not passed), surface the same prompt before proceeding

### Step 2 — Present the Execution Plan

**Pre-step: load agent operations reference.** Read [references/agent-operations.md](references/agent-operations.md) now — before composing the phase summary below. It contains the full agent-mode definitions and per-section brief content used throughout Step 3 onward. Keep it in working memory for the rest of the run.

Then output:

1. **Branch info** (if branch was created in Step 1e): `Working on branch '<branch_name>' based on '<base_branch>'.`
2. **Resumability note**: if some acceptance criteria are already checked, list which phases appear complete and confirm with the user whether to skip them.
3. **Phase summary** — total number of phases identified; for each phase: title, brief description, and which agent mode it will use
4. **GH integration note** (if GH mode): `GH-backed run — progress will sync to issue #<plan_sub_issue_number> after each phase. PR will be opened on completion (omit with --no-pr).`
5. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Research

Before implementation begins, spawn Research agents to gather codebase context. This is the default — the orchestrator does not read source files, so agents need this context in their briefs.

**Identify research topics** by scanning the plan for:

- Files, modules, or directories referenced
- APIs, types, or interfaces that phases will consume or modify
- Existing patterns that phases need to follow or extend
- Dependencies between phases that require understanding current state

**Consolidate before spawning.** Default to 2–4 research agents per run — needing more is a consolidation signal, not a bigger fan-out. Split topics by the *mental model required*, never by phase or by directory, and merge topics whose findings depend on each other: two agents each half-reconstructing one shared model (say, how the session layer and the route guard interact) is the anti-pattern this rule exists to prevent.

**Pick each topic's tier by its findings' destination** (the two tiers are defined under the Research mode in agent-operations.md), decided when the topic is composed — never by guessing output size:

- **File-backed (`general-purpose`) — the default.** Any phase brief will point at this topic's `research-<topic>.md`, or the topic serves more than one phase. Resolve the concrete file path now (suffix it if the name is already taken), pass it in the brief along with the Write Scope & Search Breadth section, and the agent writes the file itself, returning only a ≤8-line digest plus the path. The full findings never enter your context.
- **Inline lookup (`Explore`) — the exception.** The complete answer is expected to fit the ≤8-line digest and exactly one consumer needs it: inline the returned digest into that single brief as a phase-specific delta (or into your own next decision) — no file is created. If the return shows the size was misjudged, persist it verbatim to `<scratch_dir>/research-<topic>.md` and do not re-read it; a repeat miss means the topic was a survey, not a lookup — file-backed next time.

**Spawn research agents in parallel** when topics are independent. For example, if Phase 1 touches the routing layer and Phase 3 touches the API client, spawn two Research agents simultaneously — one for each area. Research never modifies the repo in either tier, so parallel execution is safe and reduces wall-clock time.

**Verify the write scope after every file-backed return.** Step 1e.2 guaranteed a clean tree and the scratch dir is git-ignored, so `git status --porcelain` must return empty. Any output means the agent wrote outside its scope: revert those paths and surface the violation to the user before proceeding. (For mid-run research — Error Handling item 4 — the tree legitimately holds phase work: snapshot `git status --porcelain` before the spawn and compare after instead. Use the same snapshot-and-compare form whenever `<keep_dirty_pathspec>` is declared — those paths keep the tree legitimately dirty from run start.)

**Skip this step only** if the plan is trivially simple (e.g., a single-phase config change with no codebase dependencies).

### Step 4 — Execute Phases

Capture `<run_start>` once (`date +%s`) — for the optional labeled "elapsed" line only; capture it at Step 3 instead when research runs, so the figure covers the whole run. Initialize the run ledger now if Step 3 did not already (see Run Ledger): create `<ledger_path>` with its header row. All reported timing comes from the ledger's summed `duration_ms`, NEVER from wall-clock `date` diffs across turns (those absorb laptop-closed / network-drop / checkpoint-pause idle and give a false read).

For each phase, sequentially:

1. **Begin the phase** — no wall-clock capture. This phase's time and cost are derived from the ledger rows its sub-agents produce (item 8), which is idle-immune.
2. **Compose the brief** — see Brief Composition Rules
3. **Spawn the agent** — see Agent Modes for which to use
4. **Receive the summary and record its usage row** (see Run Ledger — append a ledger row for EVERY sub-agent return, this step and every other). Analyze the result for success, failures, or concerns. If the summary reports a **blocking** failure, route through Error Handling **now** — before the review gate — and enter item 5 only once the blocking failure is resolved (a verified Debug fix counts; it need not produce a new Code summary). Fixes must land before the phase is reviewed and committed, never after.
5. **Stage and review the phase** (Code-mode phases only; skip if `--no-review`; skip under `--no-commits` — without per-phase commits the staged diff cannot isolate this phase — and note the skipped gate in the progress tracker):
   - Stage the phase's changes now: `git add -A` (with keep-dirty paths declared: `git add -A -- . <keep_dirty_pathspec>` — Step 1e.2). Staging before the review makes new untracked files visible to the reviewer's `git diff --cached` and freezes exactly what the verdict applies to.
   - Spawn a **Review** agent (see Agent Modes) using the dedicated Review brief in agent-operations.md. Do NOT include the Code agent's summary or self-assessment in the brief — the reviewer's independence from the implementer's self-report is the point of the gate.
   - Receive the verdict table and route:
     - **All criteria MET** → proceed to item 6.
     - **Any NOT MET** → treat as a blocking failure (see Error Handling): re-attempt via a Code agent whose retry brief includes the reviewer's NOT MET findings verbatim; counts against the phase retry limit. After the fix, re-run the review with a fresh Review agent — full by default, scoped only when the invariant's narrow exceptions below apply; verdicts are never carried over.
     - **NEEDS-RUNTIME** → proceed, but tag those criteria in the progress note and carry them to Step 5's caveats list and the PR Test plan (see completion-templates.md).
     - **Scope creep flagged** → judge it: out-of-plan refactors route to a fix like NOT MET; benign additions (e.g. an import the manifest missed) are noted and allowed.
     - **Out-of-criteria defects reported** → judge severity: a blocking defect routes to a fix like NOT MET (counts against the retry limit); a non-blocking defect worth fixing before it ships in this phase's commit takes a corrective pass (see Error Handling → Corrective-pass budget); anything else is noted and carried forward (item 10).
   - **Invariant:** the Review agent is the last thing to see the phase's diff before checkboxes are ticked (item 6) and the commit happens (item 7). Any modification after the verdict that can reach the commit — a Debug fix, a retry, anything except item 6's own plan-file checkbox edit — invalidates it: re-stage and re-run the review in full with a fresh agent before proceeding. (The commit-message scratch file never reaches the index — Step 1e.2 git-ignores it — so it cannot invalidate a verdict.) **Narrow scoped-re-review exceptions.** The re-review is full. The first exception is a post-verdict delta confined to dependency or generated artifacts — lockfiles, snapshots, codegen output. Scope the re-review to that delta plus the acceptance criteria it touches, and only once all three hold: (a) the delta is established with git, never by eyeball — `git diff --name-only` (post-verdict changes, not yet staged) IS the delta, and every file absent from that list is untouched since the verdict (names only; do not read the diff's content — Context Discipline still applies); (b) no source, config, or test file appears in it — a source or config file forces the full re-review, no exceptions, while a test file routes to the second exception below; (c) a Debug agent re-verified the runtime criteria the delta affects (its own post-fix verification satisfies this). What makes this narrow case safe: (a) proves the reviewed code is byte-identical, and (b) confines the change to artifacts no acceptance criterion is written against — so the verdict still covers everything it originally covered. **The second exception is a post-verdict delta confined to test files** — established by the same names-only mechanism as (a); if generated or dependency artifacts appear alongside the tests, they must independently satisfy the first exception's conditions, and any production source or config file forces the full re-review. Scope the re-review to the test delta, briefed to verify two things: that the change is purely additive — any weakened or removed existing assertion escalates to the full re-review, because a deleted assertion may be the very evidence a MET verdict rested on — and that the new assertions are discriminating for the criteria they claim to cover, not tautological. What makes this case safe: the names-only diff proves the reviewed production code is byte-identical since the verdict, so the prior verdict still covers it, and the test delta itself gets a fresh scoped verdict. For both exceptions: record the scoped review as a deviation in the progress note. The re-review still goes to a **fresh** Review agent — only its scope narrows, never its independence. When in doubt, full.
6. **Update the plan file** — Edit the local plan file ALWAYS to check off acceptance criteria the Review agent verified as MET (when the review gate was skipped, fall back to the Code agent's self-report — on the Debug path, as amended by the Debug agent's verified-fix report, since the last Code summary is the one that declared the failure; NEEDS-RUNTIME criteria are checked but tagged in the progress note), regardless of GH mode. **(GH mode, `gh_sync_mode == active` only)** After the Edit, sync to GitHub: `gh issue edit <plan_sub_issue_number> --body-file <plan_file_path>`. Retry 3× with backoff (250ms, 1s, 3s) on failure. On persistent failure, escalate to the user **once** with three options:
   - `retry` — try the sync again now (e.g. user just refreshed `gh auth`)
   - `continue` — set `gh_sync_mode = degraded`; skip per-phase sync for the rest of this run; one final sync attempted at end-of-run
   - `abort` — stop the run; user can resume via re-invocation

   **(GH mode, `gh_sync_mode == degraded`)** Skip the sync; note the degraded state in the next progress tracker output.

7. **Commit the phase's changes** (skip entirely if `--no-commits`):
   - `git add -A` (with keep-dirty paths declared: `git add -A -- . <keep_dirty_pathspec>` — Step 1e.2; picks up the plan-file checkbox edit; when the review gate ran, the code is already staged from item 5 — otherwise this stages it now)
   - Check `git diff --cached --quiet`; if exit code 0 (no staged changes) → skip the commit and note `(no commit — no changes)` in the progress tracker for this phase
   - **Fast path** — if the Code agent wrote its commit-message file (`<scratch_dir>/phase-<n>-commit-msg.md`, per the Commit Message Directive) AND no agent modified the phase's code after that Code agent finished (no Debug fix, no retry): commit with `git commit -F <message-file>`. If the commit-msg hook rejects the message, discard the file and use the fallback below. The fast path keeps the phase diff out of the orchestrator's context — the agent that wrote the diff authored the message.
   - **Fallback** (message file missing, post-agent changes occurred, or hook rejected the message) — invoke `Skill(skill="commit", args="#<plan_sub_issue_number>")` (omit `args` entirely if local-only mode), exactly as before. Commits reference the plan sub-issue — the narrow scope of what each commit accomplishes. The PR body separately refs the parent PRD-epic (Step 5d) for rollup tracking. The `commit` skill is the single source of truth for commit message format and type selection — do NOT duplicate format guidance here (the fast path's message file is itself authored against that skill). If a commit-msg hook rejects the fallback's message too, that is a message problem, not a code problem: re-author the message against the hook's output and retry the commit once — the diff is unchanged, so no Debug agent, no review re-run, and no charge against the phase retry limit; if the re-authored message is also rejected, escalate to the user with the hook output.
   - **Pre-commit hook failure** — spawn a Debug agent with the hook output, files involved, and what was being committed. After Debug fixes the issue: re-stage (`git add -A`, exclusion form under keep-dirty paths — the fix is not in the index yet), then re-run the review gate with a fresh Review agent per item 5's invariant (the fix changed the diff the verdict was rendered on; skip only when the gate is skipped for this run). If the re-review returns any NOT MET: first re-run item 6 in full against the new verdict table — un-check the criteria no longer MET (item 6's text says "check off", so be explicit: remove those ticks) and, in active mode, re-sync to GH with item 6's retry/escalation machinery — so neither the local file nor GH overstates progress while the phase is re-attempted or if the run stops here; then route through item 5's NOT MET path (counts against the phase retry limit) — never directly to the commit; the re-attempted phase's eventual commit starts a fresh two-attempt count. Otherwise — including when the gate is skipped for this run (no re-review, no verdicts to reconcile) — reconcile any MET ↔ NEEDS-RUNTIME drift by re-running item 6 in full (same Edit and sync rules), then retry the commit via the fallback path (a Debug fix invalidates the fast path). If the second attempt fails, escalate to the user with full context. **Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.**
   - **Delete the message file** once the commit lands (fast path or fallback): `rm -f <scratch_dir>/phase-<n>-commit-msg.md`. A stale file left by an aborted run would otherwise satisfy a later run's fast-path check and commit that phase with an outdated message.
8. **Compute phase active time + cost from the ledger** — from this phase's ledger rows, sum `duration_ms` (→ **active time**, `h:mm:ss`; rows sharing a `Parallel group` label contribute the group's **max**, not its sum — see Progress Reporting) and carry each row's `subagent_tokens` into the **Research / Code / Review** columns as its own figure (placed by mode per Progress Reporting, never summed together; **Total** = the phase's sum across all rows). Active time is idle-immune: `duration_ms` is each sub-agent's own execution, so idle between turns (closed laptop, dropped connection, a human-checkpoint pause) never inflates it — unlike a wall-clock `date` diff. A phase that spawned a Debug agent and a re-review includes those rows in its totals. (Orchestrator-side heavy commands — e.g. the commit's pre-commit hook — are excluded by default; to count one, bracket ONLY that command inside a single bash call — `s=$(date +%s); git commit …; e=$(date +%s)` — which cannot absorb user idle mid-command.)
9. **Report progress** — output the progress tracker (see Progress Reporting), including the formatted duration
10. **Carry non-blocking concerns** — blocking failures were already handled at item 4, before the review gate; note any remaining non-blocking issues from the summary or review in the progress output and carry them forward as context
11. **Proceed** to the next phase, carrying forward relevant context from the summary

### Step 5 — Completion

After all phases:

- **Classify the run first** — set `<outcome>` per its definition in Working state. Every gate below keys off it, so decide it once, explicitly, before composing anything
- Output a final summary of what was accomplished across all phases. Render the final completion table from the ledger (one row per sub-agent grouped under its phase, with phase subtotal lines and a Totals row — format in completion-templates.md, load it now), then a **Total active time** (the subtotal lines summed — idle-immune, parallel groups counted at their max) and total tokens. Optionally add one **Elapsed** line (`now − <run_start>`, `h:mm:ss`) explicitly labeled as including any pauses/idle — never present that wall-clock figure as the run's "duration"
- List any caveats, manual steps, or follow-ups
- Note any acceptance criteria that remain unchecked
- **Local-only runs (and only these):** state plainly that the work branch was never pushed and give the command — `git push -u origin <branch_name>`. Everything below this point is GH-mode only, so a run that just ends here would otherwise read as "nothing left to do"

**(GH mode, outcome is `complete` or `partial` only — skip everything below on `aborted`):**

#### Step 5a — Sync reconciliation

If `gh_sync_mode == degraded`, attempt one final `gh issue edit <plan_sub_issue_number> --body-file <plan_file_path>` to push the local file. If this final sync fails, skip Step 5b and Step 5d (do not strand a "completed" comment on a stale body and do not open a PR linked to a stale plan); surface the partial state:

```
Run completed locally. GitHub sync still failing: <error>
To sync manually after fixing the issue:
  gh issue edit <plan_sub_issue_number> --body-file <plan_file_path>
  gh issue comment <plan_sub_issue_number> --body "<final summary text>"
```

#### Step 5b — Post summary comment

Load [references/completion-templates.md](references/completion-templates.md) now — it contains the exact templates for both "complete" and "partial" outcomes, plus the `gh issue comment` invocation. Pick the template matching the run's outcome and post.

#### Step 5c — Push the work branch

Skip if `--no-branch` or `--no-commits` was passed (no branch to push, or no commits to push).

This step sits inside the GH-mode block **deliberately** — do not "fix" it by hoisting it out. A push is not a neutral local git operation: in a `<pr_open_mode> == declared` repo it is precisely what causes a PR to be opened, so a run the user scoped to local-only must not touch the remote at all.

Run: `git push -u origin <branch_name>`

If the push fails (branch protection, network, auth, force-push needed):

- Surface the error verbatim
- **Do NOT auto-force-push.** Skip Step 5d and instruct the user to resolve the push manually before opening a PR

#### Step 5c.5 — Pre-PR branch review

Skip if `--no-branch-review`, or if Step 5d will be skipped anyway (`--no-pr`, `--no-branch`, `--no-commits`, push failed in Step 5c, Step 5a's final sync failed). This gate exists to populate a PR body — never spend a branch-scope Review agent when no PR will be opened.

Spawn ONE fresh Review agent at branch scope (see the Review Brief's pre-PR variant in agent-operations.md), briefed to:

- Adversarially review the full branch diff (`git diff <base_branch>...HEAD`) for correctness bugs — especially the integration seams between phases, which no per-phase gate can see
- Check that forward-compatibility hooks named in phase summaries (list them in the brief) were actually resolved by later phases
- Verify each candidate finding against the code before reporting; return only surviving findings as a structured list

This gate is **detection-only** — never spawn fix agents from its findings autonomously; fixes happen only when the user picks that option in the routing below. The rule is load-bearing, not caution: a branch-scope finding often sits in the gap between what the plan says and what the user actually meant — a plan can even contradict itself — and only the user can say which behaviour was intended. An autonomous fix at this stage can ship the wrong mechanism fully implemented, tested, reviewed, and green; routing the finding to the user is what surfaces intent. Routing:

- All surviving findings go into the PR body's `Review notes` section (see completion-templates.md)
- If any finding is a CONFIRMED correctness bug: open the PR as **draft** instead of ready and surface the findings to the user with options — direct fixes (normal Debug/commit flow, re-push, promote) or promote as-is

#### Step 5d — Submit the PR

Skip if any of: `--no-pr`, `--no-branch`, `--no-commits`, push failed in Step 5c. **When this step is skipped and `<pr_open_mode> == declared`, say so in the final summary** — the Step-5c push already triggered the repo's workflow, so a PR exists carrying the workflow's auto-generated body, and run-plan deliberately left it untouched. (`--no-pr` cannot prevent that PR from existing; it only means run-plan does not attach its body.)

Load [references/completion-templates.md](references/completion-templates.md) if not already loaded — it contains the PR body template, draft-vs-ready rule, the PR submission flow (gated on `<pr_open_mode>` from Step 1d: `declared` → poll for the workflow's PR and attach the body via `gh pr edit`, never `gh pr create`; `silent` → `gh pr create` directly), and the PR failure-handling guidance. Use it to compose and submit the PR.

On success: report the PR URL to the user.

#### Step 5e — Delete the local plan and PRD files

Run only if ALL of the following hold:

- GH mode (`<plan_sub_issue_number>` is set)
- Run outcome is `complete` (not `partial` or `aborted` — partial runs need the file for resumability)
- Step 5d submitted the PR successfully (skipped or failed → keep the files; without a merged PR, the local file is still the most complete working copy)

When all conditions hold:

1. **Delete the plan file:** `rm <plan_file_path>`
2. **Delete the upstream PRD file** if it exists locally and was published to GH:
   - Derive the PRD path by swapping the suffix on the plan filename: `<slug>-plan.md` → `<slug>-prd.md` in the same directory
   - If that file exists AND its content contains a `<!-- gh-issue: N -->` footer (proving it was published — local-only PRDs are kept as the audit trail), `rm` it
   - If either condition fails, leave it alone
3. **Note the deletions in the final summary** (e.g. `Local plan and PRD files removed — GH issues #<gh_issue_number>/#<plan_sub_issue_number> and PR are the canonical record.` — drop the `#<gh_issue_number>/` segment when no parent PRD-epic exists — or `Local plan file removed; PRD file kept (not published to GH).`)

Rationale: the GH issues hold the final checkbox state and the PR captures the work itself, so the local files are redundant. Re-runs that need the plan file can re-fetch from GH — Step 1b's "GH ref passed → not found → fetch" path handles that automatically.

## Agent modes (quick reference)

The mode is the role; the `subagent_type` column is Claude Code's reference mapping. On another host, map each mode onto its nearest isolated-context worker by capability tier: Research's inline-lookup tier takes a read-only worker; everything else takes a general-capability worker. Research's file-backed tier and Review are read-only toward the repo *by conduct*, not by capability — the one writes only its own findings file, the other writes nothing (see the role notes in agent-operations.md; Review must also keep the same model tier as Code).

| Mode          | Claude Code `subagent_type` | When to use                                                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Research**  | `general-purpose` (file-backed, default) / `Explore` (inline lookup) | Gathering codebase context before or mid-execution; tier picked by the findings' destination (Step 3) |
| **Code**      | `general-purpose`           | Phases that create or modify code and tests (primary workhorse)              |
| **Architect** | `general-purpose`           | Phase is ambiguous about _how_ to structure something; resolve before coding |
| **Debug**     | `general-purpose`           | A Code agent reports failures it couldn't resolve                            |
| **Review**    | `general-purpose` (read-only conduct) | Independent criteria audit after each Code phase (Step 4.5); branch scope for the pre-PR review (Step 5c.5) |

For each mode's full role definition, protocol, and expected-output format, see [references/agent-operations.md](references/agent-operations.md) — loaded once at Step 2 per Context Discipline.

---

## Brief composition (skeleton)

Every agent brief MUST include these 10 sections, in order:

1. **Role Preamble** — which mode this agent is operating in (use the mode's role definition)
2. **Codebase Context** — architectural decisions, prior research findings, prior phase summaries, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md directive
3. **File Manifest** (Code mode) — Files to modify (must-read-first) and Files to reference
4. **Scoped Task** — phase description and acceptance criteria, verbatim from the plan
5. **TDD Directive** (Code mode only) — red-green-refactor workflow reminder
6. **Build Verification Gate** (Code mode only) — run the build before reporting complete
7. **Commit Message Directive** (Code mode only; omit under `--no-commits`) — author this phase's commit message to the scratch message file; never commit
8. **Write Scope & Search Breadth** (file-backed Research tier only) — write exactly one file, the resolved `research-<topic>.md` path, never touch repo source; search very thoroughly
9. **Completion Requirement** — the structured STATUS / Files changed / Tests / Build / Issues / Incomplete / Implementation details template
10. **Boundary Statement** — "only do what's in scope"

For the exact text of each section (prose, directives, completion template), see [references/agent-operations.md](references/agent-operations.md). This skeleton is the forcing function — the reference file is the full content.

**Before spawning any agent, verify the brief contains all 10 sections** (or all that apply to the mode — File Manifest, TDD Directive, Build Verification Gate, and Commit Message Directive are Code-mode-only; Write Scope & Search Breadth applies only to file-backed Research). **Exception:** Review agents use the dedicated Review Brief composition in agent-operations.md, not this skeleton.

**Keep briefs thin — reference, don't re-embed.** A brief must not re-transcribe content the agent will read for itself. Cite the plan section by name, the research file(s) by path (`research-<topic>.md`), and the prior phase's `phase-<n>-handoff.md` by path — do not paste their contents. Inline only what is specific to THIS phase: the pointers, the phase's acceptance criteria (verbatim — they are short), and the phase-specific deltas/gotchas/corrections (e.g. line-number drift, a resolved plan ambiguity). Re-embedding is the orchestrator's biggest self-inflicted context cost: the brief is YOUR output, re-sent as input on every later turn, and it duplicates the plan the agent already reads.

---

## Context Discipline

**You are the orchestrator. Stay lean.**

- **DO NOT** read source code files — delegate that to agents
- **DO NOT** read phase diffs — the Review agent reads them (Step 4.5); you receive only its verdict table (the one sanctioned exception: Step 4.7's fallback commit path runs the `commit` skill inline, which reads the staged diff)
- **DO NOT** run tests, builds, or linters — delegate that to agents
- **DO NOT** implement code changes — delegate that to agents
- **DO** read the plan file (once, at the start)
- **DO** load [references/agent-operations.md](references/agent-operations.md) once at Step 2 and keep it in working memory for the whole run (agent modes + brief content for every phase)
- **DO** load [references/completion-templates.md](references/completion-templates.md) at Step 5 when rendering the final completion table and composing the summary comment and PR body
- **DO** use the Edit tool to update plan checkboxes after phases complete (and `gh issue edit` to sync to the issue body when GH-backed)
- **DO** create the work branch (Step 1e), commit phase changes (Step 4.7), push the branch and open the PR (Step 5c–5d) — these git/GH operations are the orchestrator's responsibility, not the agents'
- **DO** commit via the Code agent's message file when the fast path applies (Step 4.7) — it keeps the phase diff out of your context; invoke the `commit` skill otherwise, and do NOT duplicate commit format guidance in this skill
- **DO** record every sub-agent's `<usage>` block into the run ledger the moment it returns (see Run Ledger), and derive ALL reported timing from summed `duration_ms` — never from wall-clock `date` diffs across turns (they absorb idle/pause time and misreport)
- **DO** broker file paths, not content — research findings live in `research-<topic>.md` (written by the file-backed Research agent itself) and each phase's downstream detail in `phase-<n>-handoff.md`; the NEXT agent reads them directly, so keep only judgment-relevant summaries (status, criteria, issues, deviations, précis) in your own context (exception: an inline-lookup Research return — the `Explore` tier can't write files — arrives inline by design and should be digest-sized; when one comes back oversized, persist it to `research-<topic>.md` on return, and path-brokering applies from that point on)
- **DO** output progress updates between phases
- **DO** carry forward only judgment-relevant context; the detailed inter-phase handoff lives in `phase-<n>-handoff.md`, which the next brief points its agent to read (you don't hold that detail yourself)
- **DO** keep each phase's terse returned summary (status/criteria/issues/deviations/précis) in working memory as the record of what happened; the ledger holds the cost/time record
- **NEVER** bypass pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, etc.) — investigate and fix the underlying failure via a Debug agent

If a phase summary is excessively long, extract only the information needed for subsequent phases.

---

## Run Ledger

Maintain an append-only ledger at `<ledger_path>` (`<scratch_dir>/ledger.md`) — the single source of truth for per-sub-agent cost/time and the data the Progress Reporting table and completion summary render from. Because it is a file, it survives context compaction: late-run reporting stays accurate even after early phases are summarized out of your context.

Initialize it before the run's FIRST sub-agent spawn — that is Step 3 when research runs, Step 4 otherwise. Do not defer it to Step 4 unconditionally: Step 3's research agents return before Step 4 begins, and a row with nowhere to land is a row held in context instead, which is exactly the `setup (research)` data most likely to be summarized away later. **Every time ANY sub-agent returns** — Research, Code, Architect, Debug, Review; every step including retries, the Debug → re-review cycle, the pre-PR branch review, and post-run follow-ups — append one row from its `<usage>` block:

| Phase | Mode | Tokens | Tool uses | duration_ms | Parallel group | Note |
| ----- | ---- | -----: | --------: | ----------: | -------------- | ---- |
| 1 | Research | 68217 | 41 | 113266 | R1 | shared video layer |
| 3 | Research | 59404 | 36 | 98112 | R1 | api client surface |
| 1 | Code | 151579 | 84 | 3057245 |  |  |
| 1 | Review | 78097 | 32 | 350528 |  | all MET |

- **Tokens** = `subagent_tokens`, **Tool uses** = `tool_uses`, **duration_ms** verbatim; **Parallel group** is blank for a solo spawn, and rows spawned concurrently in one batch share a short label (`R1`, `R2`, …) — summing `duration_ms` across a group overstates elapsed time by roughly the fan-out factor, so Progress Reporting reports a group's max with the sum as a labeled aside. Record raw numbers; format only at render time. (Progress Reporting renders each row's Tokens as its own figure in the Research/Code/Review columns — placed by mode, never summed together.)
- Attribute whole-run research to the phase it serves (or `setup`); the pre-PR review to `pre-PR`; post-run fixes to `followup`.
- **`subagent_tokens` is cumulative tokens the agent processed across its internal turns — throughput, not peak context occupancy.** Report it as throughput; do NOT present it as "% of context window" (a long agent can process far more than the window without ever occupying it). Per-agent tokens are a **cost** signal; `tool_uses` is the closest available **occupancy** proxy — nothing evicts within a single sub-agent, so its context grows monotonically with tool-using turns, and a 250-call agent ran far closer to its window than a 30-call one whatever their token figures suggest. True peak occupancy is unmeasured on this host.
- **This is a cost ledger, not a context-health ledger.** It records what each sub-agent spent; it says nothing about what stays resident in the orchestrator's own context — that occupancy is unmeasured (no mid-run signal exposes it) and is the cost Context Discipline exists to bound. Do not read a fully-populated ledger as evidence the run was context-lean.
- All reported timing derives from summed `duration_ms` here (parallel groups counted at their max — see Progress Reporting) — never wall-clock `date` diffs across turns.

**Host portability.** `subagent_tokens` / `tool_uses` / `duration_ms` are Claude Code's Task-tool `<usage>` fields. On another host, record whatever usage metadata its delegation mechanism returns, and degrade **per column** when a field is absent — the ledger, the file-handoff protocol, and the idle-immune-timing *intent* are host-agnostic; only these field names are Claude Code's:

- **Time** — prefer a duration measured by the **agent runner** (idle-immune: it excludes time the orchestrator turn is suspended). If the host exposes none, the orchestrator MAY bracket the spawn with its own clock, but must label it "wall-clock (may include idle)" — an orchestrator bracket absorbs a closed-laptop / dropped-connection pause while the agent runs, which is the whole failure mode we're avoiding. If neither is available, omit the time column.
- **Tokens** — record per-agent tokens if the host exposes them (they power the Research/Code/Review/Total columns); else omit those columns (or write `n/a`). Never fabricate a number. The same per-column rule covers `tool_uses`: record it when exposed, else `n/a`. Even on Claude Code, some agent types emit no `<usage>` block at all — the read-only `Explore` type behind inline-lookup Research is one — so an inline-lookup row reading `n/a` (tokens *and* `duration_ms`: the whole block is missing, so its time is unknown too) alongside fully-populated rows is expected behavior, not a ledger bug. File-backed Research runs on `general-purpose`, which reports usage normally, so most research rows carry real figures.

None of these figures gate control flow (retries are count-based, phases are criteria-gated), so a host exposing no usage metadata still runs the plan correctly — it just reports fewer columns.

The ledger is one of the few artifacts the orchestrator authors directly (like the plan-file checkbox edits). It lives in scratch (git-ignored) and never enters a commit.

---

## Progress Reporting

After each phase, render progress as a **GitHub-flavored markdown table** (it displays cleanly in the user's terminal — prefer it over ASCII box-art), sourced from the run ledger. The **Research / Code / Review** columns hold **per-agent token figures** — the skill's whole architecture exists to keep each individual sub-agent lean, so the table must show each agent's own cost. A per-mode sum defeats the table's purpose: `354K + 113K + 108K` rendered as `575.1K` reads as one enormous agent, the opposite of what happened:

| # | Phase | Status | Research | Code | Review | Total | Active time |
| - | ----- | ------ | -------: | ---: | -----: | ----: | ----------: |
| — | setup (research) | ✓ | 68K·59K·77K·75K | — | — | 280.0K | 0:08:25 (Σ 0:27:08, 4 parallel) |
| 1 | {short title} | ✓ Complete | — | 151.6K | 78.1K | 229.7K | 0:56:48 |
| 2 | {short title} | ✓ Complete (↻ retried) | — | 354K·113K·108K | 125K·119K·120K | 939.2K | 2:41:12 |
| 3 | {short title} | ▶ Current | — | — | — | — | — |

- **Phase** — the phase `#` plus a **short** title, truncated to ~25 chars with `…` when longer. Keep it terse on purpose: the full title already appears in the between-the-table note below and the final `Outcomes` list, so the table needn't carry it in full — and an untruncated 40–60-char title, stacked on the seven other columns, pushes this table past a standard terminal's width, where the renderer wraps cells into a ragged grid. This is the one column that can blow up the table's width in a CLI; the numeric columns are naturally narrow.
- **Research / Code / Review** — each sub-agent's `subagent_tokens` as its **own figure**, dot-separated in spawn order when the phase had several (`354K·113K·108K` — the retry count is visible at a glance). A lone agent keeps one-decimal precision (`151.6K`); multi-value cells drop to whole-K to stay compact. NEVER sum agents into one figure — a summed cell hides exactly the multiplicity that matters. The two rarer modes are **placed**, not folded: an Architect value lands in the Research column (non-implementing, pre-code) and a Debug or retry value in the Code column (fix cycles on the phase's code), each still listed individually. Upfront Step-3 research is its own `setup` row; a mid-phase Research agent (Error Handling item 4) lands in that phase's Research cell.
- **Total** — the phase's full token cost: every agent figure in the three cells summed (compute from raw ledger values, then format). This is the one place summing is correct — it reconciles the row without impersonating any single agent's size.
- **Active time** — the phase's summed sub-agent `duration_ms` (idle-immune; Step 4 item 8), `h:mm:ss`. Rows sharing a ledger `Parallel group` label contribute the group's **max**, not its sum — summed concurrent durations overstate elapsed by roughly the fan-out factor. Where a group exists, append the labeled sum: `0:08:25 (Σ 0:27:08, 4 parallel)` — the max approximates elapsed, the Σ is the work figure.
- **Status** — `✓ Complete`, `▶ Current`, `· Pending`; append a flag where relevant: `(no commit — no changes)`, `(GH sync degraded)`, `(⚠ needs-runtime)`, `(↻ retried)`.

The **final completion table** switches shape: one row per **sub-agent**, grouped under its phase with per-phase *subtotal* lines — render the ledger's rows; do not aggregate away the data the storage layer correctly keeps. It is also where `tool_uses` is reported. Format and example live in completion-templates.md, loaded at Step 5.

Read these figures from the ledger — do NOT hand-tally from memory. **Host portability:** the token columns need host-exposed per-agent token counts; without them, drop Research/Code/Review/Total (likewise `Tool uses` in the final table, and Active time if no duration is exposed) per Run Ledger → Host portability — with no usage metadata at all, the table is just `# | Phase | Status`.

Between the table and the next phase, briefly note:

- Key outcome from the completed phase (1-2 sentences)
- Any context being carried forward, and the `phase-<n>-handoff.md` path the next brief will reference
- Which agent mode the next phase will use and why (if not obvious)

---

## Error Handling

When a Code agent's summary reports failures, or a Review agent returns NOT MET verdicts:

1. **Assess severity** — Can the next phase proceed, or is this blocking?
2. **If non-blocking** — Note it in progress, carry forward as context, continue
3. **If blocking due to a bug or test failure reported in a Code agent's own summary** (NOT MET verdicts route via Step 4 item 5's counted Code re-attempt instead, never here) — Spawn a Debug agent with:
   - The failure description from the Code agent's summary
   - The files and code sections involved
   - What was being attempted
4. **If blocking due to insufficient context** — The Code agent may report that it couldn't complete the work because it didn't understand an existing pattern, couldn't find the right interface, or lacked context about how something works. In this case:
   - Spawn a Research agent scoped to the missing context, tier picked by Step 3's destination rule: findings the re-attempt brief will point at are file-destined — resolve the path first, suffixing it if the filename already exists (an earlier brief may point at the original), and the agent writes the file itself; a single missing fact is an inline lookup, inlined into the retry brief
   - For a file-backed spawn, apply Step 3's write-scope check in its mid-run form: snapshot `git status --porcelain` before the spawn and compare after (the tree legitimately holds phase work)
   - Re-attempt the phase with the additional context included
5. **After Debug or retry resolves** — Verify the fix is sufficient, then proceed to the review gate (Step 4.5): post-fix changes are unreviewed by definition, and the gate re-runs before checkboxes are ticked or the phase is committed — full by default, scoped only when Step 4 item 5's narrow exceptions apply. (For non-Code phases, or runs where the gate is skipped, continue directly.)
6. **If resolution fails** — Report to the user with full context and ask for guidance

**Retry limit:** A phase may be retried a maximum of 2 times (original attempt + 2 retries). The limit counts every **failure-driven** fix cycle on the phase — one triggered by a NOT MET verdict or a blocking failure — regardless of route: a Debug intervention (item 3) and an enriched-brief re-attempt (item 4) each consume a retry, exactly like a Code re-attempt triggered by a NOT MET verdict. (A fix cycle on a phase whose criteria all stand MET draws on the corrective-pass budget below instead.) (The Research spawn in item 4 is read-only context gathering and does not itself consume a retry — the re-attempt it feeds does.) NOT MET verdicts always route through Step 4 item 5's counted Code re-attempt, never through an uncounted Debug spawn — item 3 applies only to blocking failures reported in a Code agent's own summary. Exceptions that consume no phase retry: a Debug agent spawned for a pre-commit hook failure (Step 4 item 7) — the commit retry is bounded by item 7's own two-attempt rule, and a NOT MET from the post-fix re-review routes to Step 4 item 5's counted path, with the re-attempted phase's eventual commit starting a fresh two-attempt count — and the item 7 fallback's single message re-author (the diff is unchanged). After the limit is exhausted, escalate to the user regardless of failure type. Include both the last Code agent's summary and the last Review verdict table (if any) in the escalation.

**Corrective-pass budget:** a separately-counted budget of 2 fix cycles per phase for correcting findings surfaced while every criterion stands MET — an out-of-criteria defect (Step 4 item 5's routing), a test gap, a small fix the phase would otherwise carry into its commit as a known flaw. The counting rule is mechanical, never a judgment call: a fix cycle triggered by a NOT MET verdict or a blocking failure counts against the retry limit; every other pre-commit fix cycle counts against the corrective budget. Neither budget draws on or refreshes the other. A corrective pass is a post-verdict change like any other, so Step 4 item 5's invariant applies unchanged: fresh re-review, full by default, scoped when its narrow exceptions hold (an additive-test-only pass qualifies for the test-delta exception — the two rules compose to keep cheap polish cheap). If that re-review returns any NOT MET, the phase has genuinely regressed: route through the failure path, with subsequent cycles counting against the retry limit. When the corrective budget is exhausted, stop fixing: note the remaining findings in the progress output and carry them forward — they reach the user via the phase report and, where applicable, the PR's Review notes. Rationale: without the split, polish on a passing phase consumes the failure budget, and the incentive becomes skipping cheap correct fixes to preserve retries for hypothetical defects — exactly backwards.

**Retry protocol.** Do not retry the same phase with identical instructions. A retry brief must additionally include:

1. **Failed-attempt observations** — 2-3 sentences on the approach the failed attempt took and the decisive error output from its summary (plus the Review agent's NOT MET findings verbatim, when the review gate triggered the retry), labeled as observations from a failed attempt that the retry agent should verify independently rather than trust.
2. **An explicit working-tree statement.** Before spawning the retry, decide the tree state — never leave it undefined (an undefined tree lets a retry duplicate edits, and lets Step 4.7's `git add -A` commit half-applied leftovers):
   - **Default: revert the failed attempt.** Revert exactly the files in its Files-changed list — including any files a Debug agent modified while fixing this attempt (from its fix-applied report) — and delete any new files it created, plus its commit-message file (`rm -f <scratch_dir>/phase-<n>-commit-msg.md`) so a stale message can never ride a later fast path. Never blanket `git checkout -- .` (under `--no-commits` the tree also holds prior phases' uncommitted work). Unstage first if the failed attempt was staged in Step 4.5. State in the brief: `tree is at phase start`.
   - **Keep partial work** only when the failed summary shows it cleanly passing some acceptance criteria. State in the brief: `tree contains partial changes to <files> — build on them`.

## Resumability

The plan file is the persistent record of progress. By checking off acceptance criteria after each phase:

- If a conversation is interrupted, the user can re-run `/run-plan` on the same plan
- The orchestrator reads the checkboxes to determine which phases are already complete
- Already-completed phases are skipped (note them in the execution plan output)
- Partially-completed phases are re-attempted from scratch (unchecked criteria = incomplete)
- Checked criteria are trusted only after Step 1e's resume guards pass — Steps 1e.2/1e.3 catch checkboxes that outran their commits (recorded ticks whose phase commit never landed, or whose commits live unpushed on another machine)

**For GH-backed plans:** the synced GH issue body is the cross-machine source-of-truth. A run started on machine B will fetch the body at start (Step 1b/1c), see checkboxes from a prior run on machine A, and skip those phases. Per-phase sync (Step 4.6) keeps the GH body in lockstep with the local file during execution.

When presenting the execution plan (Step 2), if some criteria are already checked, note which phases appear complete and confirm with the user whether to skip them.
